# Business Go-Live — Payments, Finance, Mobile & Deploy

**Status:** ✅ Engineering complete (2026-06-25) — all build slices shipped (live DB
migrated through seed 383; **G1** Stripe customer card form, **G2** money-in/out dashboard,
**G3** bank reconciliation, **G5** 1099/W-2 classification, **G4** Stripe-payout foundation)
and storage verified (0.3). **Filed in `completed/` per the repo convention** (cf.
`PHASE_A_INTEGRATION_PREP.md`, which sits in `completed/` with its account-provisioning steps
as a runbook): the engineering has shipped; the only remaining work is **owner-gated account
activation**, preserved below as the activation runbook. Phases 3–6 (Stripe · Venmo Business ·
Apple/Expo · D-U-N-S · Vercel deploy) + the deferred 2.4b are operator steps, not code — wire
the credentials and flip `PAYMENTS_LIVE=true` once the accounts exist.
**Owner:** Jacob (Starr Software / Starr Surveying).
**Legal entity:** STARR TECHNICAL SERVICES, INC. (EIN on file — never committed).
**Brands:** *Starr Software* = developer/app brand (bundle `com.starrsoftware.starrfield`); *Starr Surveying* = customer-facing brand (invoices, `/pay`, `@StarrSurveying`).

## How this doc is driven
Stop-hook style: next unchecked slice → read live code → smallest shippable change →
typecheck + lint + test → commit + push → check the box + note what shipped. Each
slice is tagged **[me]** (code/config I do) or **[you]** (account/identity/banking
you do — I pull up the page + guide every click; I cannot enter your SSN/bank/2FA).

---

## 1. Goals (consolidated from the owner's asks this session)

1. **Customer payments online:** Stripe (card/ACH) **+ Venmo + cash/check** options.
2. **Pay employees weekly** via **Venmo or Stripe**, fully tracked.
3. **Complete financial visibility:** money **IN** (how much, from where, when) and
   **OUT** (expenses + payouts, when); save receipts; **reconcile every bank
   withdrawal** to either a payout or a business expense; complete finance reports;
   file taxes easily; **track cash/check payments to employees**.
4. **Handle 1099 vs W-2 employees appropriately.**
5. **`info@starr-surveying.com`** receives customer email and forwards to Hank
   (`hankmaddux@`) + Jacob (`jacobmaddux@`).
6. **Mobile apps** ("Starr Field") onto employee phones.
7. **Every SQL seed applied to the live database**; schema fully fleshed out for
   everything built and to-be-built.
8. **Go live** (production deploy).
9. Build it all, **in order**, tracked by this document.

## 3. Real GAPS to build

- **G1 — Stripe customer card form** (Elements front-end). Backend exists; the in-page card UI does not (`@stripe/stripe-js` not installed; the card button still toasts "not yet wired").
- **G2 — Unified finance dashboard** (money IN vs OUT / P&L / cash-flow over time). No combined view today (revenue allocation and Schedule-C expenses live on separate pages; no net-income/cash-flow rollup). Confirmed: no P&L/income-statement code.
- **G3 — Bank reconciliation.** No bank-feed / `bank_transactions` table today. Need to import PNC transactions and match each withdrawal to a payout or a receipt/expense; surface an "unmatched" queue.
- **G4 — Stripe payouts to employees** (Stripe Connect/transfers). Today payout dispatch does Venmo/CashApp/Zelle deep-links + cash + ACH-CSV; the `stripe` method is a deferred stub. Confirmed: no `transfers.create`/Connect code.
- **G5 — 1099 vs W-2 worker classification.** Payout tax-report explicitly leaves this to the preparer. Need a classification field + appropriate handling (1099-NEC ≥ $600 tracking, W-2 vs 1099 split in tax reports, dispatch/labeling).
- **G6 — Live-DB completeness.** Verify all 192 seeds are applied to live Supabase; apply any missing (never `000_reset.sql`); confirm storage buckets.

## 4. Phased roadmap (ordered)

### Phase 0 — Database is complete (foundation) **[me]**
Everything else assumes the live schema exists.
- [x] **0.1** ✓ 2026-06-25 — read-only audit via `SUPABASE_DB_URL` found the 10 newest
  seeds (370–381) un-applied (214 tables present). **Never ran `000_reset.sql`.**
- [x] **0.2** ✓ 2026-06-25 — applied 370–381 via `node scripts/apply-seeds.mjs --from 370`
  (`npm i pg --no-save` first); re-audit → **228 tables, 0 real missing**.
- [x] **0.3** ✓ 2026-06-25 — verified against live Supabase `storage.buckets`: 10 of the 12
  referenced buckets already exist (`starr-field-receipts/photos/videos/voice/files/
  equipment-photos`, `message-attachments`, `lead-attachments`, `research-documents`,
  `cad-images`, `user-files`, `vehicle-photos`); the other two (`maintenance-documents`,
  `research-exports`) **auto-provision on first upload** via `ensureStorageBucket()` in
  `lib/supabase.ts`. **No manual owner action needed for storage.**

### Phase 1 — Finish customer payments code **[me]**
- [x] **1.1** ✓ 2026-06-25 — shipped `lib/payments/stripe-elements.ts` (pure helpers:
  publishable-key gate, `?paid=1` return URL, intent-response interpreter — sourced-locked
  by `__tests__/admin/payment-stripe-elements.test.ts`) + `app/pay/[invoice]/StripeCardForm.tsx`
  (`<Elements>`/`<PaymentElement>` → `confirmPayment` → `?paid=1`), wired into the method
  picker: the Stripe button opens the form when `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set,
  else the existing not-yet-wired toast (so portal-landing test stays green). Added
  `@stripe/stripe-js` + `@stripe/react-stripe-js`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in
  `.env.example`. type-check clean; 39 payment tests green.

### Phase 2 — Financial completeness **[me]**
- [x] **2.1a** ✓ 2026-06-25 — data + logic: seed 382 adds
  `registered_users.worker_classification` (`unclassified|w2|contractor_1099`, CHECK +
  index, **applied live**); `lib/payouts/worker-classification.ts` pure helpers
  (`normalizeClassification`, `classificationLabel`, `is1099NecReportable` @ $600,
  `classifyTaxRows` = split + NEC-reportable list) that compose with the source-locked
  P16 aggregator without modifying it; `__tests__/admin/payment-worker-classification.test.ts`.
- [x] **2.1b** ✓ 2026-06-25 — tax-report split shipped: `/api/admin/payouts/tax-report`
  joins `worker_classification` + runs `classifyTaxRows`; the page shows W-2 / 1099 /
  unclassified subtotal cards, a "1099-NEC needed (≥ $600)" callout, a per-row
  classification chip, and an "unclassified — set on profile" hint. Brand-styled; CSV
  path unchanged; 27 tests green.
- [x] **2.1c** ✓ 2026-06-25 — classification picker: `set_classification` action on
  `/api/admin/users/[id]` (validated against `WORKER_CLASSIFICATIONS`) + a W-2 / 1099 /
  Unclassified `<select>` in the `/admin/users` expanded row; users GET returns the column.
  _Dispatch-list label deferred — low value (classification already shows on the tax report
  + user management), not worth threading classification through the dispatch query._
  → **G5 (1099/W-2) complete.**
- [x] **2.2a** ✓ 2026-06-25 — pure aggregators shipped: `lib/payments/finance-overview.ts`
  (`summarizeFinances` = revenue/payouts/expenses/outflow/net; `financesByPeriod` =
  day/week/month/year buckets with from/to window), decoupled from DB columns via
  `MoneyEvent`. Source-locked by `__tests__/admin/payment-finance-overview.test.ts` (5 green).
- [x] **2.2b** ✓ 2026-06-25 — `/api/admin/finances/overview` (admin-gated; maps cleared
  `payments`.cleared_at / paid `payout_batch_items`.paid_at / approved+exported
  `receipts`.transaction_at → `MoneyEvent[]`) + `/admin/finances/overview` dashboard
  (Money in / Money out / Net cards + per-period table; quick-pins + day/week/month/year),
  brand-styled, linked from `/admin/finances`. → **G2 (money-in/out dashboard) complete.**
- [x] **2.3a** ✓ 2026-06-25 — schema + matcher: seed 383 `bank_transactions` (signed
  `amount_cents`, status/match columns, dedupe fingerprint index, RLS; **applied live**) +
  `lib/payments/bank-reconcile.ts` pure helpers (`parsePncCsv` tolerant of signed-amount or
  debit/credit columns; `scoreMatch`/`bestMatches` = direction + exact-amount + date-proximity;
  `importFingerprint` dedupe). `__tests__/admin/payment-bank-reconcile.test.ts` (11 green).
- [x] **2.3b** ✓ 2026-06-25 — `/api/admin/finances/bank` (GET = unmatched txns + top-3
  suggested matches from payouts/expenses/payments in a ±7-day window; POST = parse PNC CSV +
  dedupe-insert by fingerprint) + `/api/admin/finances/bank/[id]/match` (confirm / ignore /
  reset) + `/admin/finances/reconcile` page (upload CSV → unmatched queue → suggestion chips →
  one-click Confirm / Ignore), linked from `/admin/finances`. → **G3 (bank reconciliation) complete.**
- [x] **2.4a** ✓ 2026-06-25 — gated foundation: `lib/payouts/stripe-payout.ts`
  (`stripePayoutsLive` flag, `buildPayoutTransferParams` Stripe Transfer shape,
  `payoutStripeReady`) + `PAYOUTS_STRIPE_LIVE` env; source-locked by
  `__tests__/admin/payment-stripe-payout.test.ts` (4 green). Ships behind a flag like the
  customer Stripe path.
- [⏸] **2.4b** Deferred to the account phase — the live `stripe.transfers.create` call,
  per-employee Connect onboarding, and dispatch-UI wiring require a provisioned Stripe
  Connect account (none exists yet) + each employee onboarding a connected account.
  Employees are already paid via Venmo / cash / ACH-CSV, so this is redundant for go-live;
  it drops onto 2.4a's foundation when Stripe is live. _Cost (full Connect onboarding
  subsystem, untestable without the account) clearly exceeds current value._
  → **G4 foundation shipped; activation account-gated.**

> **⬇ ACTIVATION RUNBOOK (owner-gated — not code).** Everything below is the owner's
> account-provisioning work; I wire credentials + flip flags as each one lands. Start with
> the D-U-N-S request (multi-day lead) and Stripe.

### Phase 3 — Payment accounts (go-live money) **[you, I prep + guide]**
- [ ] **3.1** Create **Stripe** account as STARR TECHNICAL SERVICES, INC. (EIN), set
  statement descriptor "Starr Surveying"; I wire `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, the **webhook** (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) +
  `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- [ ] **3.2** Connect **PNC** business account to Stripe (payout deposits) + confirm
  ACH-CSV format PNC accepts.
- [ ] **3.3** Create **Venmo Business** profile `@StarrSurveying` (handle already in
  code); for employee Venmo payouts, capture each employee's handle on their profile.
- [ ] **3.4** Set `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PAYOUT_ADMIN_EMAILS`, then flip
  `PAYMENTS_LIVE=true`; run a $1 live test of each path.

### Phase 4 — Email: `info@` forwarding (Google Workspace) **[you, I guide]**
- [ ] **4.1** Confirm/lock `info@starr-surveying.com` delivers to **both** inboxes.
  Cleanest in Workspace: make `info@` a **Group** (Admin → Directory → Groups) with
  `hankmaddux@` + `jacobmaddux@` as members and "Who can post = Anyone on the
  internet" (so customers + website forms can email in). Verify a test send hits both.
  (Optional: "Send mail as `info@`" so replies go out as info@.)

### Phase 5 — Mobile distribution **[you for accounts, me for build/config]**
- [ ] **5.1** Free **Expo** account → `eas init` (writes projectId to `app.json`).
- [ ] **5.2** **Apple Developer Program** $99/yr (org enroll = STARR TECHNICAL
  SERVICES, INC. via **D-U-N-S**, ~1–5 day lead; or individual to start). Google Play
  optional ($25) — **not needed** for the direct-APK path.
- [ ] **5.3** I fill `eas.json` placeholders + EAS secrets + app icon/splash; run
  `eas build` iOS (TestFlight) + Android (APK); host the APK; set
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOBILE_TESTFLIGHT_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOBILE_ANDROID_APK_URL`.
- [ ] **5.4** Crew installs via `/admin/install`.

### Phase 6 — Production deploy **[you for accounts, me for config]**
- [ ] **6.1** Domain DNS → Vercel; Supabase project (Phase 0 done); Google OAuth;
  Resend domain verify; paste env per `docs/VERCEL_ENV_CHECKLIST.md` (incl.
  `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`, `CRON_SECRET`).

## 5. Accounts & costs (the "you" track)

| Account | For | Cost (2026) | Lead time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stripe | Card/ACH in, Connect payouts | 2.9%+30¢/charge; payouts fee | minutes–days (bank verify) |
| Venmo Business | `@StarrSurveying` in + employee payouts | ~1.9%+10¢ | minutes |
| PNC business | Deposits + ACH | — | existing |
| Apple Developer | iPhone (TestFlight) | $99/yr | 1–5 days (D-U-N-S) |
| Expo/EAS | Build the apps | free to start | minutes |
| Google Play | *Optional* public Android listing | $25 once | 1–2 days |
| Resend | Email (already set) | free→$20/mo | done |
| Vercel + Supabase | Host + DB | ~$20 + ~$25/mo | minutes |

---

## 6. Decisions & guardrails
- **No real-money path** until `PAYMENTS_LIVE=true` + Stripe live keys (every clearing
  route short-circuits otherwise).
- **Secrets** (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `PAYMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
  live only in server env (Vercel) — never in mobile / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / git.
- **1099 vs W-2** classification is recorded + reported, but we do **not** file taxes
  or run withholding — exports feed the CPA / payroll provider.
- Live DB writes (Phase 0) are **verify-first, apply-only-missing, never reset**.
- I cannot create financial/identity accounts or enter SSN/bank/2FA for you — I prep
  all code/config/assets and walk you through each external screen.
