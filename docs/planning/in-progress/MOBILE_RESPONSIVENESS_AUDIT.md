# Mobile Responsiveness Audit & Build-Out

> Goal: every admin ("backend") page is fully usable and well-formatted on a
> phone. Nothing too big or too small, nothing overlapping, nothing off-screen
> or out of place. Every page, button, field, text, and interface looks good at
> 360–430px wide.

**Status:** 🟡 In progress — auditing in slices.
**Owner:** mobile build-out effort (2026-06).
**Primary viewport:** 390 × 844 (iPhone 12/13/14). **Stress viewport:** 360 × 800 (small Android).

## 1. How this doc is driven

Work happens in **slices**, one area per slice. Each slice:

1. **Audit** the pages in that area (method below) and record findings in the
   per-page catalogue (§5) — every layout/styling fix the page needs.
2. **Update this doc** with the findings and a concrete fix plan.
3. **Commit** the doc update (the slice's deliverable).

Once the **whole surface is audited** (every row in §5 is `🔍` or `✅`), the
effort flips to **build-out**: work the §6 fix backlog, implement the mobile
fixes area-by-area, re-verify, and mark rows `✔️`.

### Status legend
| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ⬜ | Not yet audited |
| 🔍 | Audited — issues found (see notes / backlog) |
| ✅ | Audited — already mobile-clean, no work needed |
| 🔧 | Fix in progress |
| ✔️ | Fixed & verified on phone viewport |

## 2. Audit method

Pages are audited with a layered method because the app is data-driven and the
render harness only has empty stub data:

1. **Structural render pass (automated).** `/ux-harness` renders the real page
   component at 390px with a seeded admin session; a Playwright script measures
   `documentElement.scrollWidth − clientWidth` (horizontal overflow) and flags
   any visible element whose right edge pokes past the viewport. Script:
   `scratchpad/audit.js` (reusable). **Result of first run (45 top-level pages):
   0 horizontal overflow on every page** — the global shell + `AdminResponsive.css`
   hold up structurally.
2. **CSS responsive review.** Read the governing stylesheet(s) for the page and
   check for: fixed `px` widths/min-widths that exceed ~360px, grids/flex rows
   that don't collapse to one column, tables without horizontal scroll or a card
   fallback, modals/drawers wider than the viewport, absolute-positioned overlays.
3. **JSX review.** Check the page/component for inline `style={{ width: … }}`
   fixed px, hardcoded column counts, and tap targets < 40px.
4. **Visual spot-check.** Screenshot in the harness where the page renders with
   stub data (forms, empty states, static content render fine; list/table pages
   need seeded data — tracked per page).

Breakpoint conventions already used in the codebase (reuse these, don't invent
new ones): **768px** (tablet/handoff), **600/599px** (phone), **480px** (small
phone), **380px** (very small). Tokens live in `app/admin/styles/tokens.css`.

### Established responsive conventions (reuse, don't reinvent)
- **Responsive grids:** `repeat(auto-fill/auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr))`
  collapses to one column on a phone with no breakpoint (e.g. WorkspaceLanding,
  verified clean). Or explicit `3 → 2 → 1` column steps at 1100/640px (AdminMe).
- **Table-wrap convention:** wide tables sit in an `overflow-x: auto` wrapper
  (`.um-table-wrap`, etc. — 14 stylesheets) so the table scrolls **inside its
  card** instead of pushing the page wide; secondary columns are hidden at
  768px (`th:nth-child(n){display:none}`). **Primary table audit check: every
  `<table>` must have such a wrapper, else it overflows the page once populated.**
  (The empty-data structural pass cannot catch a missing wrapper — populated or
  code review only.)

## 3. Stylesheet responsive-coverage census

Mobile breakpoints (`@media max-width ≤ 820px`) per admin stylesheet. Thin/zero
coverage = prime suspects; `AdminResponsive.css` centralizes cross-page mobile
overrides so a low count here does not always mean the page is broken.

| Stylesheet | Mobile BPs | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AdminResponsive.css | 54 | Central mobile override sheet (layout-global) |
| AdminLearn.css | 39 | Learning hub + modules |
| AdminResearch.css | 33 | Research workspace |
| AdminRewards.css | 16 | Rewards/store |
| AdminLayout.css | 9 | Shell (sidebar/topbar/cards/buttons) |
| AdminMessaging.css | 8 | Messages |
| Calendar.css | 7 | Calendar |
| AdminFieldWork.css | 5 | Fieldbook / field UI |
| AdminMe.css / AdminTimeLogs.css | 4 | Hub / time logs |
| TestingLab / EmployeePond / CalculatorModal / AdminUsers / AdminPayroll / AdminMyNotes / AdminErrors / AdminArticle | 3 | Thin |
| AdminJobs / AdminLogin / EmailCompose / IconRail / AdminEmployeeManage | 2 | Thin |
| AdminAssignments / AdminDiscussions / AdminNotes / AdminPageHeader / AdminSchedule / Leads / install | 1 | Very thin |
| **WorkspaceLanding.css** | **0** | ⚠️ workspace landing tiles — verify wrap |
| **AdminAudit.css** | **0** | ⚠️ audit log table — verify mobile table |
| **AdminCommandPalette.css** | **0** | Cmd+K palette — likely fine (centered modal) |
| **payments-admin.css** | **0** | ⚠️ payments inbox — verify |

## 4. Slice plan

Audit slices (record findings in §5/§6):

- [x] **S1 — Hub:** workspace landings (work/office/research-cad) ✅ clean; me/dashboard/my-files/schedule/time-off audited (need data-render verification — see §6).
- [ ] **S2 — Work:** jobs(+[id], field, new, import), leads(+[id]), calendar, finances, mileage, vehicles, timeline, team(+[email]), field-data(+[id]), assignments, hours-approval, reports(+job/[id]), invoicing(+categories), invoices/new, payments/inbox, receipts(+new)
- [ ] **S3 — Equipment:** equipment + all subroutes (today, timeline, catalogue, templates, consumables, maintenance, overrides, fleet-valuation, checked-out, inventory, import, crew-calendar)
- [ ] **S4 — Research & CAD:** research + subroutes, research/testing, cad
- [ ] **S5 — Learning:** learn + all subroutes (modules, lessons, quizzes, flashcards, exam-prep, knowledge-base, manage, students, etc.)
- [ ] **S6 — Office/Admin:** employees(+manage), payroll, payouts(+runs/dispatch/tax), billing, settings, org-settings, orgs, users, roles/custom, notes, announcements, support, weather
- [ ] **S7 — Communication:** messages(+conversation/new/contacts/settings), discussions(+[id]), contacts(+[id]), email/new
- [ ] **S8 — Rewards & Pay:** rewards(+admin/how-it-works), pay-progression(+[email]), payout-log, my-pay, my-hours, my-jobs, my-notes
- [ ] **S9 — Account/Roles:** profile, audit, error-log, work-mode + all role variants, learn/fieldbook

Build-out slices (after audit complete): B1…Bn, one per area, working the §6 backlog.

## 5. Page catalogue

Columns: **Audit** = audit status, **Fix** = fix status, **Notes** = governing
stylesheet + findings. Dynamic `[param]` pages share their parent's stylesheet
and are audited via code review (no harness render without seeded params).

## 6. Fix backlog

Populated during audit slices. Each item: `[area] page — issue — fix`. Worked
during build-out slices.

**Cross-cutting (all areas):**
- [ ] **Table-wrapper sweep** — confirm every `<table>` (55 files) sits in an
  `overflow-x: auto` wrapper. Unwrapped tables overflow the page once populated.
  Build a static check + spot-render with seeded rows. (Primary mobile risk.)
- [ ] **Data-render verification** — list/table/dashboard pages render blank in
  the empty-data harness; seed representative rows for key endpoints so their
  mobile layout can actually be screenshotted (deferred to per-area slices).

**S1 — Hub:**
- [ ] time-off — has a `<table>`; verify it has an overflow-x wrapper.
- [ ] me / dashboard / my-files / schedule — verify card grids + lists at 360px
  with seeded data (no static issues found in CSS review; grids are responsive).

---

## 7. Changelog

- **2026-06-23 — Slice 0 (setup):** Created doc. Ran structural render pass
  (45 top-level pages, 390px) → **0 horizontal overflow** everywhere. Took CSS
  responsive-coverage census (§3) and recorded breakpoint conventions. Built the
  full 152-route catalogue (§5). Reusable audit tooling in `scratchpad/audit.js`
  + `/ux-harness` registry (added `learn`, `messages`, `payout-log`).
- **2026-06-23 — Slice 1 (Hub):** Workspace landings (work/office/research-cad)
  verified mobile-clean (auto-fill grid, screenshot). Hub/dashboard grids are
  responsive (3→2→1). Documented two established conventions in §2 (auto-fill
  grids; table-wrap `overflow-x:auto`). Identified the **table-wrapper sweep** as
  the primary cross-cutting mobile risk (empty-data pass can't catch it).
