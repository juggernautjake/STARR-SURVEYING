# Hub grid editor + estimate-banner-green CTA

*Opened 2026-05-29 as a direct follow-up to
`hub-greeting-edit-affordances-2026-05-29.md` (Slices 218–220).*

## What the user asked for

> "I want the Enter Work Mode to be the same type of green that we
> have for the estimate calculator on the front end. It should have
> cool hover and click effects. Also, I liked the customizable
> widget size grid control we had before. I want to have a grid
> viewer like that again. Whenever the user clicks the Customize
> widgets button, a grid should appear. Pick a widget type, then
> click grid squares to set the size of that widget. They need to
> be able to delete or edit size. Add as many widgets as fit in the
> 8×8 grid. The 8×8 maps to the actual hub on save."

Two asks:

1. **Enter Work Mode button → match `--gradient-green` aesthetic** —
   the same emerald gradient the landing-page
   `.home-estimate-banner__btn` lives on (`#10B981 → #059669`),
   with rich hover (`translateY(-2px)` + brightness boost) +
   active (click) feedback.
2. **Grid-painter widget editor** — a new modal/overlay that
   appears when the surveyor clicks **Customize Hub**:
   - 8×8 visible grid (matching the canvas's runtime grid).
   - Left palette: every registered widget, searchable, click to
     "select" a type.
   - With a type selected, click a starting cell + a finishing cell
     to paint that widget into that rectangle.
   - Painted widgets render as colored blocks with the widget label
     so the surveyor can see what's where.
   - Click a painted widget → resize handles + delete button.
   - On Save → the grid serializes to `WidgetInstance[]` and lands
     on the canvas.

## What already exists (no rebuild needed)

| Piece | Where it lives |
|-------|----------------|
| Estimate banner green CTA aesthetic | `app/styles/Home.css` `.home-estimate-banner__btn` |
| `--gradient-green` token | `app/styles/globals.css` (`#10B981 → #059669`) |
| 8-col grid math + collapseLayout/compactLayout | `lib/hub/grid-math.ts` |
| AddWidgetModal (current "add widget" flow) | `lib/hub/components/AddWidgetModal.tsx` |
| SettingsPanel (per-widget customization) | `lib/hub/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` |
| `useHubStore` draft + commit pipeline | `lib/hub/hub-store.ts` |
| `setDraftWidgets` action | `lib/hub/hub-store.ts` |
| Widget catalog filter (search) | `lib/hub/widget-catalog-filter.ts` |
| Sortable canvas (Slices 98–220) | `lib/hub/components/WidgetGrid.tsx` |

## What's missing

- The Enter Work Mode green is a flat `var(--color-success)` —
  doesn't match the gradient + cool transitions on the landing
  estimate banner.
- There's no grid-painter editor. The current flow is "+ Add
  widget" (modal) → widget added at end of layout → drag/resize
  individually. The surveyor's mental model wants direct
  manipulation: "I want this widget HERE, this big."

## Phases + slices

### Phase 38 — Match the Enter Work Mode CTA to the estimate-banner green (Slice 221)

#### Slice 221 — Gradient green + cool hover/click ✅ shipped
- **Scope:** Update `.hub-greeting__work-mode-btn` so the button
  uses `var(--gradient-green)` (the same `#10B981 → #059669`
  emerald gradient the landing-page estimate banner CTA is built
  on). White text. Layered shadow with a green tint so the button
  reads as "the green thing". Hover: lift via
  `translateY(-2px)` + `filter: brightness(1.05)` + bigger glow.
  Active (click): `translateY(0)` + reset to the resting shadow
  with a quick `transition: 80ms` so the press registers.
- **Files:** `app/admin/me/AdminMe.css`,
  `__tests__/admin/me/hub-greeting-style.test.tsx` (extend).
- **Done when:** The Enter Work Mode button reads like a sibling
  of the landing-page estimate banner CTA — same green family,
  same lift-on-hover feel.
- **Depends on:** Slice 218.
- **Done:** Replaced the flat `var(--color-success)` background with `var(--gradient-green)` (the same `linear-gradient(135deg, #10B981 0%, #059669 100%)` token the landing-page `.home-estimate-banner__btn` uses), and the border switched from a solid `--color-success` outline to `transparent` so the gradient reads cleanly. Bumped padding from `0.85rem 2rem` → `0.95rem 2.1rem`, font-size from `1.05rem` → `1.08rem`, min-width from `12rem` → `13rem`, and added `text-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.18)` so the label punches off the gradient. Resting box-shadow grew its green-tinted glow (`0 6px 20px rgba(16,185,129,0.38) + 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.22)`) to match the marketing button's weight. Transition properties were retuned to `transform / box-shadow / filter @ 180ms ease` — the marketing banner CTA's exact recipe. Hover now mirrors the landing CTA: `translateY(-2px)` + `filter: brightness(1.05)` + a bigger glow `0 10px 28px rgba(16,185,129,0.5) + 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)`, no color shift (the brightness boost is what reads as "active"). Active state presses the button back: `translateY(0)` + `filter: brightness(0.97)` + shadow shrinks + transition snaps to `80ms` so the click registers as a deliberate tactile press instead of a slow tween. New `:focus-visible` rule pins a 2px white outline + 3px offset for keyboard users. The CTA also got `position: relative; z-index: 1;` so its shadow can render outside the greeting card's stacking context. 19 vitest specs across `__tests__/admin/me` (10 existing + 9 new/expanded from Slice 218's 8) lock the gradient + hover/active/focus contracts — each state's CSS block is regex-matched + every visible token is asserted. `tsc` + `eslint` clean.

### Phase 39 — Grid-painter widget editor (Slices 222–225)

#### Slice 222 — `GridEditor` shell + 8×8 grid + widget palette
- **Scope:** New `lib/hub/components/GridEditor.tsx` that renders
  as a full-screen modal when the surveyor clicks
  `CustomizeHubButton`. Left: scrollable widget palette (uses the
  existing `widgetsForRoles` + `filterCatalog` from the
  AddWidgetModal). Right: an 8×8 grid of square cells. Footer:
  Save / Cancel + a small "Selected: {widget}" status pill.
  Selecting a widget in the palette puts the editor in "place
  mode". The grid renders any widgets already in the draft layout
  so the surveyor can pick up an in-progress edit. This slice
  ships the layout shell only — clicking grid cells is a no-op.
- **Files:** new `lib/hub/components/GridEditor.tsx`,
  `lib/hub/components/HubCanvas.tsx` (replace the AddWidgetModal
  mount with a GridEditor mount gated on edit-mode), new
  `__tests__/hub/grid-editor-shell.test.tsx`.
- **Done when:** Clicking Customize Hub opens the grid editor
  showing the palette + empty 8×8 grid.
- **Depends on:** Slice 218.

#### Slice 223 — Place a widget via click-start + click-end
- **Scope:** With a widget type selected in the palette, clicking
  a grid cell sets the top-left of the new widget; the next click
  sets the bottom-right. The rectangle is clamped to the widget's
  min/max envelope. On commit, the widget is added to
  `draftWidgets`. Esc cancels mid-place. The grid renders an
  "outline preview" between click-1 and click-2 so the surveyor
  sees the candidate footprint.
- **Files:** `lib/hub/components/GridEditor.tsx`,
  `__tests__/hub/grid-editor-place.test.tsx`.
- **Done when:** A surveyor can pick a widget type + draw a
  rectangle on the grid + see the widget land on the canvas after
  Save.
- **Depends on:** Slice 222.

#### Slice 224 — Show placed widgets on the grid + click-to-select + delete
- **Scope:** Each widget in the draft is painted onto its grid
  rectangle as a colored block with the widget label centered.
  Hover shows a soft outline. Click selects (outline + size
  badge). With a widget selected, pressing Delete or clicking a
  ✕ button at the top-right of the painted block removes the
  widget from the draft.
- **Files:** `lib/hub/components/GridEditor.tsx`,
  `__tests__/hub/grid-editor-selection.test.tsx`.
- **Done when:** Surveyor can see what widget is where + select +
  delete from the grid.
- **Depends on:** Slice 223.

#### Slice 225 — Resize a placed widget by dragging its corner
- **Scope:** When a widget is selected, drag the bottom-right
  corner of its painted rectangle to resize it (snapped to grid
  cells + clamped to its definition's min/max). The same drag
  mechanism the existing `WidgetResizeHandle` uses, repurposed
  for grid coordinates.
- **Files:** `lib/hub/components/GridEditor.tsx`,
  `__tests__/hub/grid-editor-resize.test.tsx`.
- **Done when:** Surveyor can resize a painted widget in the
  editor + the result lands on the canvas after Save.
- **Depends on:** Slice 224.

---

## TL;DR

- Slice 221 finishes the user's "match the estimate-calculator
  green" ask (CSS-only).
- Slices 222–225 ship the grid-painter editor in four bite-sized
  layers (shell → place → select+delete → resize).
