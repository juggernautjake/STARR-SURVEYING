This module covers approximately 15% of the exam and introduces the measurement science principles that every surveyor must master.\n\nYou will learn the different types of surveys including boundary, topographic, construction, and geodetic surveys. Understanding when each type applies and what deliverables they produce is essential for both the exam and professional practice.\n\nMeasurement theory forms the backbone of this module. You will study the distinction between precision and accuracy, learn how to identify and classify errors as systematic, random, or blunders, and understand how errors propagate through calculations. The statistical concepts of standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and confidence intervals are tested heavily on the FS exam.\n\nUnits of measurement including the US Survey foot versus the International foot, degrees-minutes-seconds, and metric conversions round out this module. Pay careful attention to significant figures rules as they appear frequently in exam problems."},{"type":"concepts","title":"Key Concepts","content":"## Types of Surveys\n\nBoundary (cadastral) surveys establish property lines and corners. Topographic surveys map terrain features and elevations for planning. Construction surveys provide layout and grade control. ALTA/NSPS surveys meet specific title insurance standards. Geodetic surveys account for earth curvature over large areas.\n\n## Precision vs Accuracy\n\nPrecision refers to the closeness of repeated measurements to each other (repeatability). Accuracy refers to the closeness of measurements to the true value. A measurement can be precise but not accurate if systematic error exists. The goal is always both high precision and high accuracy.\n\n## Error Types\n\nSystematic errors follow a pattern and have a consistent sign. They are eliminated through proper procedures, calibration, and corrections. Random errors are unpredictable, follow a normal distribution, and cannot be eliminated but can be minimized by averaging. Blunders are mistakes caused by carelessness and must be detected and removed.\n\n## Significant Figures\n\nLeading zeros are never significant. Captive zeros between nonzero digits are always significant. Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant. The number 0.00340 has 3 significant figures. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise input."},{"type":"formulas","title":"Essential Formulas","content":"**Standard Deviation:** sigma = sqrt(sum(v^2) / (n-1)) where v = residual (observation - mean), n = number of observations.

You will learn how to set up and use automatic levels and digital levels, take backsight and foresight readings, and compute elevations through a leveling circuit. Understanding the relationship between the Height of Instrument (HI), backsight (BS), and foresight (FS) readings is absolutely critical.\n\nTrigonometric leveling extends these concepts to situations where direct leveling is impractical, such as across valleys or to inaccessible points. You will learn how vertical angles and slope distances combine to determine elevation differences.\n\nCurvature and refraction corrections become important for longer sight distances. The combined correction formula accounts for the earth''s curvature and atmospheric refraction. Closure requirements and adjustment methods ensure your leveling results meet the required accuracy standards."},{"type":"concepts","title":"Key Concepts","content":"## Differential Leveling\n\nThe level is set up between two points. A backsight (BS) reading is taken on a point of known elevation to establish the Height of Instrument (HI). A foresight (FS) reading is then taken on the point whose elevation is unknown. HI = Known Elev + BS. Unknown Elev = HI - FS. Turning points (TP) are used to extend the level circuit beyond a single setup.\n\n## Curvature and Refraction\n\nEarth''s curvature causes level surfaces to diverge from a horizontal line. Atmospheric refraction partially offsets this effect by bending the line of sight downward. The combined correction is C_R = 0.0206 * F^2, where F is the distance in thousands of feet. At 1 mile (5.28 thousand feet), C_R is approximately 0.574 ft.\n\n## Closure and Adjustment\n\nA level loop should close back to the starting benchmark with zero misclosure in theory. The actual misclosure is compared to the allowable closure for the survey order. First-order leveling allows about 0.017 * sqrt(miles), while second-order allows about 0.035 * sqrt(miles). Closure is distributed proportionally among the turning points.\n\n## Collimation Error\n\nIf the line of sight is not truly horizontal, a collimation error exists.

You must understand and apply corrections for temperature, tension, sag, and slope. Each correction has a specific formula and sign convention.

Slope distances must be converted to horizontal distances using the vertical angle or elevation difference.\n\nBearings and azimuths are the two primary systems for expressing directions.

Understanding satellite positioning, coordinate systems, and datums is essential for contemporary practice.\n\nThe Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) includes GPS (US), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (EU), and BeiDou (China). GPS requires a minimum of 4 satellites for a 3D position fix. The Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) quantifies how satellite geometry affects positioning accuracy; lower PDOP values indicate better geometry.\n\nGeodetic datums define the reference framework for coordinates. NAD83 and WGS84 are the primary datums used in North America and by GPS respectively. Understanding the difference between the geoid (an equipotential gravity surface approximating mean sea level) and the reference ellipsoid is critical. The relationship H = h - N connects orthometric height, ellipsoidal height, and geoid undulation.\n\nState Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCS) and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) are map projections that allow 3D positions to be represented on a 2D plane.

The receiver computes the range to each satellite from the signal travel time. Four satellites are needed: three for position and one to solve for receiver clock error. Static GPS involves long occupation times (30 min to hours) for highest accuracy. RTK GPS provides real-time centimeter accuracy using a base station.\n\n## Datums and Ellipsoids\n\nNAD27 uses the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid with an origin at Meades Ranch, Kansas. NAD83 uses the GRS80 ellipsoid and is Earth-centered. WGS84 is virtually identical to NAD83 at the centimeter level. Datum transformations are required when converting between systems.\n\n## Geoid vs Ellipsoid\n\nThe ellipsoid is a smooth mathematical surface. The geoid is an irregular equipotential surface that follows mean sea level. Orthometric height (H) is measured from the geoid. Ellipsoidal height (h) is measured from the ellipsoid. Geoid undulation (N) is the separation: H = h - N.\n\n## SPCS and UTM\n\nSPCS uses Lambert Conformal Conic projection for states wider E-W and Transverse Mercator for states longer N-S.

You must understand how to identify and describe land parcels using this system, including quarter sections and government lots.\n\nMetes and bounds descriptions define parcels by starting at a Point of Beginning (POB) and describing each boundary line with its direction and distance. Understanding the hierarchy of calls (priority of evidence) is critical: natural monuments prevail over artificial monuments, which prevail over distances, which prevail over area.\n\nRiparian rights apply to land bordering flowing water, while littoral rights apply to land bordering lakes and seas.

Original survey corners and monuments have special standing and control over computed positions.\n\n## Riparian and Littoral Rights\n\nRiparian rights attach to land bordering streams and rivers (flowing water). Littoral rights attach to land bordering lakes and oceans (non-flowing water). Both include the right of access to the water. Accretion (gradual addition of land) belongs to the riparian/littoral owner. Avulsion (sudden change) does not change boundaries.\n\n## Adverse Possession\n\nRequires possession that is: hostile (without permission), actual (physical occupation), open and notorious (visible), exclusive (not shared with owner), and continuous for the statutory period.
