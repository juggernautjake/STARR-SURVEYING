---

## Known Gaps / Phase 2+ Work

| Gap | When to Address |
|-----|-----------------|
| `CodeViewer` is never populated with actual code traces — left panel is empty until worker emits `codeTrace` events | Phase 2: Worker instrumentation |
| Timeline only has start/complete events — no per-file/per-function trace events | Phase 2: Worker instrumentation |
| SSE stream (`/testing/stream`) polls worker but worker doesn't yet emit phase-level events | Phase 2: Worker event emitter |
| `FullPipelineTab` currentPhase only updates from log parsing — not from real phase events | Phase 2: Worker phase event emitter |
| `LogViewerTab` loads logs from the API but has no feed from active TestCard runs (no shared log store) | Phase 2: Shared log store / event bus |
| Multi-branch side-by-side comparison UI not yet wired (BranchSelector UI is ready, branch is now forwarded to all API calls) | Phase 3 |
| `paused` CardStatus in TestCard is defined but never set (requires worker pause support) | Phase 2 |
| No test coverage (unit or e2e) for Testing Lab components | Phase 4 |

---

## 1. Goals

| # | Goal | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | Keep **production UI** (`/admin/research`) unchanged | Admins can still run the full pipeline end-to-end |
| 2 | Build **Testing Lab** (`/admin/research/testing`) | Admin-only debugger for every scraper, analyzer, and pipeline phase |
| 3 | **Execution Timeline** with event markers | Scrub through execution history, see exactly when each event fired |
| 4 | **Code Viewer** showing live execution trace | See which file/function is running in real-time, multi-tab |
| 5 | **Speed Control** — slow execution down dramatically | Comprehend what's happening step-by-step |
| 6 | **Pause / Resume / Rewind** | Stop at any point, review logs, rewind timeline |
| 7 | **GitHub Branch Integration** | Switch branches, pull code, edit and push from the UI |
| 8 | **Multi-branch parallel runs** | Run the same test on two branches side-by-side |

## 3. Execution Timeline

The timeline is the centerpiece of the debugger. Every test run produces a
linear sequence of `TimelineEvent` objects.

### 3A. TimelineEvent Structure

```typescript
interface TimelineEvent {
  id: string;                     // uuid
  timestamp: number;              // ms since run start
  type: EventType;
  label: string;                  // short description
  description: string;            // full description (shown on hover/click)
  file?: string;                  // source file path
  function?: string;              // function name
  line?: number;                  // line number
  data?: unknown;                 // event-specific payload
  duration?: number;              // ms (for span events)
}

type EventType =
  | 'phase-start'       // blue marker
  | 'phase-complete'    // green marker
  | 'phase-failed'      // red marker
  | 'api-call'          // purple marker — outbound HTTP
  | 'ai-call'           // orange marker — Claude API call
  | 'browser-action'    // cyan marker — Playwright action
  | 'data-found'        // green dot — data point extracted
  | 'warning'           // yellow marker
  | 'error'             // red marker
  | 'screenshot'        // pink marker — screenshot captured
  | 'log'               // gray dot — general log entry
  | 'checkpoint';       // white diamond — pause point for slow mode
```

### 3B. Timeline Bar UI

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  0s        5s        10s       15s       20s       25s     30s  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interactions:**
- **Hover** any marker → tooltip with event label + timestamp
- **Click** any marker → jump to that point in time, update logs + code viewer
- **Drag scrubber** → scroll through time, all panels update reactively
- **Keyboard:** Left/Right arrows step between events, Space = pause/resume

### 3C. Timeline ↔ Log Sync

When the user scrubs the timeline to time `T`:
- Logs **before T** → shown in full color (black text)
- Logs **after T** → greyed out (visible but dimmed, `opacity: 0.3`)
- The **most recent log at T** is highlighted with a blue left border
- Auto-scroll positions the highlighted log entry in the center of the viewer

### 3D. Timeline ↔ Code Viewer Sync

When the timeline cursor is at time `T`:
- The code viewer shows the file/function that was executing at time `T`
- The active line is highlighted with a yellow background
- If multiple files were involved, tabs appear for each file
- The active tab auto-switches to match the current event's file

---

## 4. Code Viewer / Editor

### 4A. Read-Only During Execution

While a test is running (or paused mid-execution), the code viewer is
**read-only**. It shows:
- The current file being executed (auto-detected from timeline events)
- Syntax highlighting (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Line numbers with the active line highlighted
- Multiple tabs when multiple files are involved
- Auto-scrolls to the active function/line

### 4B. Editor Mode (When Paused or Idle)

When no test is running, the code viewer becomes an editor:
- Full text editing with syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Basic keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S = save to branch)
- File tree sidebar showing the current branch's files
- "Save & Push" button commits and pushes to the current branch

### 4C. Implementation

We'll use a lightweight syntax highlighter (no Monaco — too heavy).
Instead: `<pre><code>` with CSS-based highlighting and contentEditable
for edit mode. This keeps the bundle small.

```typescript
interface CodeViewerProps {
  files: CodeFile[];              // files to display as tabs
  activeFileIndex: number;        // which tab is active
  activeLine?: number;            // highlighted line (yellow bg)
  readOnly: boolean;              // true during execution
  onSave?: (file: CodeFile) => void;  // called on Ctrl+S
}

interface CodeFile {
  path: string;                   // e.g. "worker/src/counties/bell/scrapers/cad.ts"
  content: string;                // file content
  language: string;               // "typescript" | "javascript"
  highlightedLines?: number[];    // lines to highlight
}
```

---

## 5. Speed Control & Playback

### 5A. Speed Slider

```
Speed: [0.1x ━━━━━●━━━━━━━━━━━ 10x]
```

- **0.1x** — 10x slower than normal (each step waits 10x longer)
- **1x** — real-time (default)
- **10x** — fast-forward through delays
- Preset buttons: `[0.1x] [0.25x] [0.5x] [1x] [2x] [5x] [10x]`

### 5B. Playback Controls

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `◀◀` | Jump to previous event |
| `◀` | Step back one event |
| `▌▌` / `▶` | Pause / Resume |
| `▶` | Step forward one event |
| `▶▶` | Jump to next event |

### 5C. How Speed Control Works

The worker sends events via SSE (Server-Sent Events). The frontend receives
them in real-time but **buffers** them. The speed slider controls the
**playback rate** of the buffer:

- At 1x: events are displayed as they arrive
- At 0.1x: events are queued and released 10x slower
- At 10x: buffered events are flushed immediately

When **paused**, new events still arrive and buffer — they just don't render.
When resumed, they play back at the selected speed.

---

## 6. Pause / Rewind / Review

### 6A. Pause

- Click `▌▌` or press Space
- Execution on the worker **continues** (we don't halt the worker)
- But the **UI playback freezes** — no new events render
- The timeline scrubber stops advancing
- New events buffer silently
- Code viewer becomes editable (for the branch files, not live execution)

### 6B. Rewind

- Drag the timeline scrubber backward
- All panels update to show state at that point in time:
  - **Logs:** entries after the cursor point are greyed out
  - **Code Viewer:** shows the file/line that was active at that time
  - **Output Viewer:** shows the results available at that time
  - **Test Card:** shows the status at that time (running/success/error)

### 6C. Review Mode

After a run completes:
- The full timeline is available for scrubbing
- All events, logs, code traces are preserved
- Can rewind to any point and inspect everything
- "Export Run" button saves the full timeline + logs as JSON

---

## 7. GitHub Branch Integration

### 7A. Branch Selector

```
┌─ Branch ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current: [main ▼]  [Pull] [New Branch]        │
│                                                │
│ Compare: [feature/new-scraper ▼] [Pull]       │
│          □ Enable side-by-side comparison      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 7B. Operations

| Operation | How | API |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **List branches** | Dropdown populated from GitHub | `GET /api/admin/research/testing/branches` |
| **Switch branch** | Select from dropdown, pulls file content | `GET /api/admin/research/testing/files?branch=X&path=Y` |
| **Pull latest** | Fetch latest from remote | `POST /api/admin/research/testing/pull` |
| **View file** | Load any file from any branch | `GET /api/admin/research/testing/files?branch=X&path=Y` |
| **Edit & push** | Edit in code viewer, commit + push | `POST /api/admin/research/testing/push` |
| **Create branch** | Branch from current | `POST /api/admin/research/testing/branches` |

### 7C. Multi-Branch Parallel Runs

When "side-by-side comparison" is enabled:
- Two test cards appear side by side
- Left runs on Branch A, Right runs on Branch B
- Both have independent timelines, logs, code viewers
- Results are shown in a diff-style comparison view
- Requires the worker to support a `branch` parameter (or we deploy
  branch-specific worker instances)

### 7D. Implementation Notes

GitHub integration uses the GitHub MCP tools available in the project,
plus API routes that execute `git` commands on the server:

```typescript
// API routes for branch operations
POST /api/admin/research/testing/branches     // create branch
GET  /api/admin/research/testing/branches     // list branches
GET  /api/admin/research/testing/files        // read file from branch
POST /api/admin/research/testing/push         // commit + push changes
POST /api/admin/research/testing/pull         // pull latest
```

```
POST /api/admin/research/testing/run
```

Thin proxy to worker. Accepts any module name, maps to the right worker endpoint.

```typescript
interface TestRunRequest {
  module: string;           // "cad-scraper" | "phase-1" | etc.
  inputs: Record<string, unknown>;
  projectId?: string;
  speed?: number;           // playback speed multiplier

}
```

### 9B. SSE Stream for Real-Time Events

```
GET /api/admin/research/testing/stream?runId=xxx
```

Server-Sent Events stream that proxies the worker's WebSocket events
and adds code-trace metadata.

---

## 13. What Does NOT Change

- `app/admin/research/page.tsx` — **one-line addition** (link to Testing Lab)
- `app/admin/research/[projectId]/page.tsx` — **no changes**
- All existing research components — **no changes** (only imported)
- All existing API routes — **no changes**
- Worker code — **no changes** (events already streamed via WebSocket)
- `AdminResearch.css` — **no changes**

---

## 14. Security

- Testing Lab is **admin-only** (enforced in layout.tsx + middleware.ts)
- API routes check `session.user.role === 'admin'`
- Worker auth via existing `WORKER_API_KEY` Bearer token
- Git operations are server-side only (no client-side git access)
- Branch push operations require additional confirmation
- No new secrets required
